Johnson’s (English) Sir William Johnson, Guy Johnson and John Johnson - had an unrivaled legacy of close ties with the Iroquois. Sir William intermarried with the family of Joseph Brant, and, for years, as Superintendant of Indian Affairs in the Northern Department, was England’s most potent influence on Iroquois politics, until his death in 1774.           Kirkland, Samuel (American) The Rev. Samuel Kirkland was a Presbyterian missionary among the Iroquois Indians (1764-1808). He helped persuade many Oneidas and Tuscaroras to assist the Americans during the Revolutionary War. He was a guide and chaplain on Sullivan’s Expedition.

He returned to New Hampshire and became its first president, then served in the new Congress.           Tuscarora Known as “Ska-Ruh-Reh,” or Shirt Wearing People. Driven out of the Carolinas by losing a war with settlers (1711-1713), they were the last to join the Iroqouis Confederacy. Largely sided with the Americans during the American Revolution.           Van Schaick, Goose (American) Under Clinton’s command, Col. Van Schaick laid waste to Onondaga villages in April, 1779.

There are memorial sites in Groveland, Cuylerville and Rochester’s Mt. Hope Cemetery.        Brodhead, Daniel (American) Commander ordered by Washington to destroy a series of towns of the Allegheny Seneca and their allies, on his way to link up with Sullivan and Clinton.

Butler, John (English) England’s main field operative in Iroquois country. Defeated at Newtown by Sullivan/Clinton, he organized a Loyalist force called Butler’s Rangers.

Jemison, Mary (Scotch-Irish/Seneca) The famed “white woman of the Genesee.” She was captured by Indians, then became wife to a Delaware, then Seneca chief and bore six children.

Johnson’s (English) Sir William Johnson, Guy Johnson and John Johnson - had an unrivaled legacy of close ties with the Iroquois. Sir William intermarried with the family of Joseph Brant, and, for years, as Superintendant of Indian Affairs in the Northern Department, was England’s most potent influence on Iroquois politics, until his death in 1774.        Kirkland, Samuel (American) The Rev. Samuel Kirkland was a Presbyterian missionary among the Iroquois Indians (1764-1808). He helped persuade many Oneidas and Tuscaroras to assist the Americans during the Revolutionary War. He was a guide and chaplain on Sullivan’s Expedition. After the war, he attended several treaty negotiations in which the Iroquois relinquished substantial amounts of their land. (Bio by Christine S. Patrick.)        Mohawk Known as “Kanienkahagen,” or People of the Flint. They were/remain the designated Keepers of the Iroquois Eastern Door. Sided with the English during the American Revolutionary War.

Largely sided with the Americans during the American Revolutionary War.        Red Jacket A principal Seneca sachem (chief) and political rival to Mohawk war leader Joseph Brant.

He returned to New Hampshire and became its first president, then served in the new Congress.        Tuscarora Known as “Ska-Ruh-Reh,” or Shirt Wearing People. Driven out of the Carolinas by losing a war with settlers (1711-1713), they were the last to join the Iroqouis Confederacy. Largely sided with the Americans during the American Revolution.        Van Schaick, Goose (American) Under Clinton’s command, Col. Van Schaick laid waste to Onondaga villages in April, 1779. It permanently removed the military threat from the east to Sullivan-Clinton’s subsequent operations in September, 1779.        Washington, George (American) The Commander-in-Chief of the Continental Army and America’s first president.
