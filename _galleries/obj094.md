War Memorial Monument to the more than 400 Yankee soldiers and settlers slain in the July, 1778 attack on Wyoming Valley by Tory and Indian forces under John Butler and Sayenqueraghta.

**Note:**
The pretext and 1/2 of the build-up, march and launch of Sullivan/Clinton all happened in Pennsylvania.
