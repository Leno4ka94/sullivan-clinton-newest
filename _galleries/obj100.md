The most common historical image (19th century) of the killings of July 3, 1778 in the Wyoming Valley. Today, the Pennsyl- vania Historical and Museum Commission holds there was a bloody defeat, but no general massacre afterwards.

**Note:**
The pretext and 1/2 of the build-up, march and launch of Sullivan/Clinton all happened in Pennsylvania.
