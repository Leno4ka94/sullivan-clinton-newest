American Col. Hartley's Expedition is remember -ed by this 1929 plaque for having burned Teoga and Queen Esther's Town. It was another turn in a brutal cycle of reciprocal violence against Settler and Indian villages on the Wild East frontier.

**Note:**
The pretext and 1/2 of the build-up, march and launch of Sullivan/Clinton all happened in Pennsylvania.
