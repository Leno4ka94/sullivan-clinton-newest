Distressed, this tree expires on the very site of the Boyd-Parker ambush by the Senecas, three days before Sullivan's burning of nearby Little Beard's Town, the Seneca capital and Western Door.

**note:**
The Onondaga capital, Onondaga Castle, was burnt on April 12-13, 1779. At Rt. 11, near Onondaga. The Seneca capital, Little Beard's Town, was burnt on Sept. 14-15, 1779. At Rt. 39, near Geneseo. The Cayuga capital, Goi-O-Guen, was burnt on Sept. 22-23, 1779. At Rt. 90, near Aurora. See its 1929 Redux, in the L. P. Hecht Gallery.
