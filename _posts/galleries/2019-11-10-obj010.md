An installation consisting of a display of contemporary acrylic watches printed with imagery taken from the work of Swiss pioneer artist Peter Rindisbacher. Their design and production, including the "Chippewatch" logo, was the artist's contribution to the 1996 Swiss Institute exhibition Red River Crossings: Contemporary Native American Artists Respond to Peter Rindisbacher (1806-1834).
