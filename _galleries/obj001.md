Steve's allegorical painting is a commentary on and companion to the once well-known national icon, "The Murder of Jane McCrae," painted by John Vanderlyn in 1804. Her killing in 1777 was one of the events (along with the so-called Wyoming Valley and Cherry Valley massacres of 1778) that created an atmosphere in which the Sullivan-Clinton Campaign against Iroquoia was launched in 1779.
