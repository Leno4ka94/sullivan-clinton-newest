The "Three Sisters" - corn, squash and beans - are at the heart of Haudenosaunee survi- val and worldview. Their destruction was an objective of Sullivan/ Clinton. While this 1508 village is Secotan, both peoples had advanced agrarian know-how. S/C officers' journals gush with surprise, before burning such towns.
