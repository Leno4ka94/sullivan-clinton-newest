In September 1778, Col. Thomas Hartley led over 200 troops against the region's Haudeno- saunee and Delware villages, to avenge the July defeat and bloody aftermath in the Wyoming Valley.

**Note:**
The pretext and 1/2 of the build-up, march and launch of Sullivan/Clinton all happened in Pennsylvania.
