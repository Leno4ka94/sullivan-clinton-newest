In 1774, Silas Deane backed annexing northern PA to Litchfield County, CT, as the Town of Westmoreland. CT's projecting its "western claim" - through Hartford's Susquehanna Co. - was proof of "the Glory of this New World."

**Note:**
The pretext and 1/2 of the build-up, march and launch of Sullivan/Clinton all happened in Pennsylvania.
